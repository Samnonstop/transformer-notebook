# Transformer Architecture Tutorial

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on the Transformer architecture, combining theory and practical implementation. The tutorial is designed for educational purposes and includes both theoretical explanations and step-by-step code implementation in PyTorch.

## Contents

- [Step_By_Step_Transformer.ipynb](Step_By_Step_Transformer.ipynb): Detailed Jupyter notebook with complete Transformer implementation
- [Transformer_Theory_Introduction.md](Transformer_Theory_Introduction.md): Theoretical foundations and architecture overview
- [Training_Example.md](Training_Example.md): Example training setup and best practices

## Key Features

- Complete implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch
- Detailed explanations of each component (multi-head attention, positional encoding, etc.)
- Visual demonstrations and mathematical foundations
- Training examples and practical considerations
- Follows the original "Attention is All You Need" paper

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic understanding of deep learning concepts

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Transformer_Theory_Introduction.md` for theoretical background
3. Work through `Step_By_Step_Transformer.ipynb` for implementation
4. Reference `Training_Example.md` for training guidance

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the complete Transformer architecture
- Implement each component from scratch
- Learn best practices for training Transformers
- Build foundation for advanced architectures (BERT, GPT, etc.)
